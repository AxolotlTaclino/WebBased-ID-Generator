# WebBased-ID-Generator
Basic Web Based ID Generator 

A bit of backstory on how I decided to start this project:

Back when I was in college specifically during the summer break of 2018, my brother was helping out one of his friend who is an owner of a small local airline HR company, with creating new Identification Cards for their business. Since my brother never learned how to use Photoshop, he asked me if I could do it instead and he'll just pay me. So, I did it and made IDs for more than 200 of their employees.

The following year, my brother informed me that the company had some new recruits and some have also left so they would need new IDs again. So, I helped them out and work on more than 150 IDs. 

However, COVID-19 happened and I haven't received worked from that company and I also got a job as a Developer Support in a U.S. based company with a work from home setup. But then earlier this month, my brother informed me again that the company needs to create new IDs again but unfortunately I am busy and don't really have the time to manually work on those IDs anymore.

So instead, I thought of a creating a web-based ID generator, where the ID template is already set and the user would only need to input the employee information and upload their photo and signature. Then, it will generate a finished ID in JPG format.

I want the project to have a simple interface which will allow any company employee or even my brother to use it.

I'll be editing the ID template on this public repository for the sake of the company's privacy.

I'm already 80%(?) done with the code while writing this and I'll upload the files as soon as I make sure that the company template has been fully changed.
